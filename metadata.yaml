description: Though she is as indelible and sharply drawn a character as Scarlett
  O' Hara, Dixie Hart, the protagonist of William N. Harben's novel of the same name,
  has never known the finer things in life. After struggling her entire life to make
  ends meet, a sudden change in circumstances adds even more to her burden. Will Dixie
  ever get the respite -- and love -- she so sorely deserves?
